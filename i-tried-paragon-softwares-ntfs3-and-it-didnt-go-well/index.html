And because I need read/write support, my only option has always been, of course, <code>ntfs-3g</code>. This, however, changed sometime in September 2021, when Paragon Software&rsquo;s <code>ntfs3</code> driver was <a href=https://www.phoronix.com/news/NTFS3-For-Linux-5.15>merged</a> into the Linux kernel.</p><p>Recently I&rsquo;ve upgraded my laptop to Fedora 37 which includes, along with kernel 6.x, the new <code>ntfs3</code> driver. So I decided to modify the <code>/etc/fstab</code> entry for the Windows partition to use the new, fast <code>ntfs3</code> instead of the old, slow <code>ntfs-3g</code>. Everything&rsquo;s been fine up until today, when I noticed that a folder disappeared from the NTFS filesystem. The weird thing is that the directory wasn&rsquo;t visible with <code>ls</code> or any GUI file manager, but I could still <code>cd</code> into it. Similarly, enclosed files weren&rsquo;t visible with <code>ls</code>, but could still be accessed by programs, knowing the filenames. For example, my torrent client could still seed existing files from there. This behavior screamed only one thing: filesystem corruption. So I booted into Windows to schedule a <code>chkdsk</code> run, which indeed fixed the thing.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t prove it was a bug in the <code>ntfs3</code> driver to cause this, but I think it&rsquo;s reasonable to think so. Especially considering I&rsquo;ve never experienced anything like this with <code>ntfs-3g</code>, which I&rsquo;ve been using since&mldr; forever. There&rsquo;s at least one <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/uca3fu/ntfs3_driver_is_orphan_already_what_we_do/i69453f/>place</a> on the web that seems to corroborate this thesis.</p><p>All this to say that maybe we should stick to the <del>bad</del> good old <code>ntfs-3g</code>, at least until we <a href=https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linus-Torvalds-NTFS3-Comments>hear</a> from Paragon itself.</p></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
