I started to write this as a comment on Reddit, but soon I realized I didn&rsquo;t want to give away free content to a platform that doesn&rsquo;t value its users anymore (at least not the way it used to). But let&rsquo;s not digress.</p><p>First of all: who am I? For the sake of this post, I think it&rsquo;s sufficient to say that I&rsquo;m a Linux user, as probably you are. After the infamous rite of passage known as distro-hopping, I finally settled on Fedora, which happens to ship GNOME as the default desktop experience&mdash;mind you, defaults matter. As a user, there are quite a few gripes that I have with GNOME&rsquo;s default file manager Nautilus, and judging from the project&rsquo;s issue tracker they seem to be shared by more than a bunch of people. I&rsquo;ll list my top 5:</p><ol><li><strong>Lack of type-ahead search<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></strong>. Believe it or not, triggering a full-blown recursive search doesn&rsquo;t replace the ability to focus a particular file in the current folder by simply typing (part of) its name. I suspect 90% of users&mdash;especially those coming from Windows or macOS&mdash;expect the latter behavior. As some folks like to say&mldr; <em>if it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it</em>.</li><li><strong>Thumbnail generation is painfully slow<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></strong>. There&rsquo;s not much to be said about this. You can try it yourself by opening a folder full of pictures for the first time and observe how long it takes for all thumbnails to be displayed.</li><li><strong>Search is so slow it locks up the UI<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></strong>. When typing a file name to search, sometimes the whole UI freezes for a few seconds. My limited experience suggests that some piece of synchronous code probably needs to be revised, but I&rsquo;m just guessing.</li><li><strong>Icons keep moving downwards while thumbnails are being generated<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup></strong>. This is a good old one. Together with (2), I can only imagine how miserable photographers' experience must be. Not to mention the lack of thumbnails in GTK&rsquo;s file picker, which amounts to a meme now<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup>. Since it&rsquo;s technically not part of Nautilus, I wont&rsquo;t dig deeper.</li></ol><p>I understand GNOME lacks resources, but oh boy, when I see developers' time and effort spent on endlessly redesigning and rewriting core apps, I wonder: is that really necessary? How about working on these <em>major</em> issues instead? One of them dates back to 2006. I guess that fixing a 16 years old bug is not as exciting as rewriting the default image viewer in Rust<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup>.</p><p>What baffles me is that Nemo, Cinnamon&rsquo;s default file manager, has none of the aforementioned problems. And guess what, it&rsquo;s essentially what GNOME&rsquo;s file manager used to be before the catastrophe that began with the release of Nautilus 3.6 sometime around 2012<sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup>.</p><p>I hate when people shrug off the problem of Nautilus being an underperforming piece of software by simply saying: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Linux, you&rsquo;re free to use something else&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s not a solution, it&rsquo;s diverting attention from the problem itself. I can&rsquo;t wrap my head around the fact that such a fundamental and user-facing application of an OS is being almost neglected.</p><p>Maybe what I&rsquo;m ranting about is an inherent consequence of community-maintained software, where a bunch of generous people contribute to what <em>they</em> want in their limited spare time. Users can complain how they want, but they can&rsquo;t expect someone with the necessary skills and time to magically show up and fix such issues.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know much about the dynamics of GNOME as a community project, so probably this is a wild and naive take, but couldn&rsquo;t the GNOME Foundation allocate some funds to a sort of bug bounty program to incentivize fixing major, long-standing issues?</p><section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/nautilus/-/issues/1157>https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/nautilus/-/issues/1157</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/nautilus/-/issues/856>https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/nautilus/-/issues/856</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:3 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/nautilus/-/issues/246>https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/nautilus/-/issues/246</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:3 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:4 role=doc-endnote><p><a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=335743">https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=335743</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:4 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:5 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/File_Picker_meme>https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/File_Picker_meme</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:5 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:6 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://gitlab.gnome.org/BrainBlasted/loupe>https://gitlab.gnome.org/BrainBlasted/loupe</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:6 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:7 role=doc-endnote><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130313170552/http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com/?p=198">https://web.archive.org/web/20130313170552/http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com/?p=198</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:7 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></section></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright &copy; 2022 Random thoughts &bull; Theme by <a href=https://lukasjoswiak.com/>Lukas Joswiak</a> &bull; Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></footer></body></html>
